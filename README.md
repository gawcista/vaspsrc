# vaspsrc
Python3 scripts for processing VASP output data

gnuplot, ImageMagick is required to process images

bandplot.py is a script to plot all kinds of band structures, only vasp OUTCAR files is required. (first meta finished)

the following scripts are still under testing:
pdos.py: prints PDOS and LDOS; DOSCAR is required;
wan_band.py:plots wannier band structure generated by Wannier90; wannier90_band.gnu, wannier90_band.dat and OUTCAR from SOC self-consistent step (to get Fermi level) is required;
par.py: generates fat-bands for certain orbitals/atoms; to be optimized;
hse_kpoint: generate HSE k-points from IBZKPT files from self-consistent step and band plot non-scf step by PBE;
fitting.py: fit energy-lattice constant/volume curve with BM phase equation, prints the lattice constant/volume with lowest energy;
read_dip.py: calculate dipole moment from an OUTCAR;

the following scripts are not useful for you:
atom.py: not finished, I forgot why I created this script:)
auto_series.py: automatically make lattice constant optimization for a series of systems, just a simple case;
read.py: planned to be a head file
modify.py: modify POSCAR for some usage;
band.py and bandsoc.py: the old version to plot bands; bandplot.py is better
